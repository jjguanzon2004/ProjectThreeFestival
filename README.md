## Project Overview

The Asian Voices Rise is a three day celebration of AAPI culture and representation. As a response to decades of media exclusion and misrepresentation, the festival seeks to highliglht new Asian talent, foster community, and educate others on the history, culture, and contributions of the Asian American community. From December 11-13, teh festival will hold fun filled events such as a flea market, art exhibitions, film viewings, and a day long concert. Featuring Asian American artists, guest musicians, and social activists, the festival seeks to appeal to younger Asian Americans struggling with defining their own experience and identity. It serves as a safe space for Asian Americans to resonate with others, share their stories, and promote divertity within the community.
