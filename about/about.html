                <h2>At its core, the Asian Voices Rising Festival is a safe place for Asian Americans to be heard,
                    acknowledged, and accepted. As we bring together Asian artists from film,
                    music, literature, dance, and entertainment, we hope these stories 
                    resonate with the masses. With the collective power of Asian artists, 
                    we believe we can redefine what it means to Asian American in today's world.
