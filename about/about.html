                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p>For decades, Asian Americans have struggled to gain a foothold in 
                    film, music, and entertainment. From the early depcitions of the 
                    "Fu Man Chu" and "Dragon Lady" to the ongoing fight for authentic
                    representation, the systemic barriers have limited opportunities 
                    and perpetuated harmful attitudes toward the AAPI community.
                    That stops here.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We aim to undo the long history of dicrimination, misrepresentation,
                    and exclusion of Asian Americans in the media. At its core, the Asian
                    Voices Rising Festival is a safe place for Asian Americans to be heard,
                    acknowledged, and accepted. As we bring together Asian artists from film,
                    music, literature, dance, and entertainment, we hope these stories 
                    resonate with the masses. With the collective power of Asian artists, 
                    we believe we can redefine what it means to Asian American in today's world.
